# ESP32 + Arducam Mini 2MP Plus Edge Impulse Example

__NOTE:__ This repository is a one-off example with inferencing only, and does not make use of ESP32 hardware optimizations. The ESP32 is now fully supported by Edge Impulse - with optimizations, examples, and tutorials for the ESP32-CAM board included. It is recommended to follow [docs.edgeimpulse.com](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/development-boards/fully-supported-development-boards) instead of this repository, and only continue here if you specifically need to interface the `Arducam Mini 2MP Plus` with your ESP32 kit.

## Overview
This project runs an Edge Impulse designed image classification impulse on an ESP32 dev kit. These images are captured using a connected ArduCAM Mini 2MP Plus camera board.

This project is intended to work within the Arduino framework using PlatformIO. It is also compatible with the Arduino IDE. If you would like to use the Arduino IDE/CLI to build this project, See the [FAQ](#faq) section for more information.

## Prerequisites
- You have an ESP32 dev kit
- You have an ArduCAM Mini 2MP Plus board
- You have jumper wires to connect the ArduCAM to the correct ESP32 pins
- (Optional) You've created an Edge Impulse account, and followed one of the image classification tutorial to understand how to train machine learning model with Edge Impulse:
  - [adding sight to your sensors](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/image-classification) 
- You've installed [PlatfomIO](https://platformio.org/install) - the IDE, CLI, or vscode extension all work equally well here

## Hardware Setup

Before running this project, the ArduCAM must be connected to the ESP32 dev kit. To do this:

1. Review the pin-out diagram for your specific ESP32 dev kit. There are multiple kit variations for ESP32. For instance for the 30-pin 'DOIT DEVIT V1 ESP32-WROOM-32', the pinout is shown below:
![RNT ESP32 Pinout](https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ESP32-DOIT-DEVKIT-V1-Board-Pinout-30-GPIOs-Copy.png?w=966&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1)

2. Using the jumper wires, connect the following pins on the ESP32 kit to the ArduCAM in the order they appear. Ensure that the ESP32 is not powered during this

|ESP32 |ArduCAM|Description        |
|:-----|:------|:------------------|
|Pin 5 | CS    |Chip Select for SPI|
|Pin 23| MOSI  |SPI MOSI           |
|Pin 19| MISO  |SPI MISO           |
|Pin 18| SCK   |SPI Clock          |
|Pin 21| SDA   |I2C Data           |
|Pin 22| SCL   |I2C Clock          |
|GND   | GND   |Common ground      |
|VCC   | VCC   |5V connection pin  | 

Note: VCC may be labelled '5V' on some ESP32 kits

3. Double check that the pin connections are correct, and then connect the ESP32 to your computer via the ESP32's micro-USB port. We will verify that the hardware is connected correctly when testing out the firmware

## Software Setup

Assuming PlatformIO is set up correctly, all dependencies should be fetched automatically based on the information in the platformio.ini file when the project is built.

If you are using the platformIO CLI you can build, program, and monitor the serial output from the ESP32 using:
```
platformio run --target upload --target monitor --environment esp32dev
```

You may need to press the `BOOT` button on the ESP32 kit when you are prompted with
```
Connecting........_
```
to get the board to program. After the board is finished programming, the code will begin taking photographs, and classifying the image with the default included impulse.

If you are using the IDE/VScode, see the [PlatformIO docs](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/espressif32/arduino_debugging_unit_testing.html#compiling-and-uploading-the-firmware) on including and building the project. Select 'Upload and Monitor' when building.

## Verify program output

After programming, the first thing you should see is initialization status messages:
```
Serial Interface Initialized.
SPI initialized.
I2C initialized.
Camera initialized.
```

During these steps some checks are performed to make sure the ArduCAM is working properly. If errors occur here, the program will stall until they are cleared. These errors will generally be due to some hardware fault. First triple check the [hardware connections](#hardware-setup), then check the [FAQ](#faq) for more troubleshooting information.

If initialization is successful, the program will now count down, take a photo, and classify the output in a loop:
```
taking a photo in 3... 2... 1...
*click*
run_classifier returned: 0
Predictions (DSP: 4 ms., Classification: 1999 ms., Anomaly: 0 ms.):
[0.95312, 0.04688]
    non_person: 0.95312
    person: 0.04688
```

The default loaded model is a simple classifer that classifies if a person is present in the captured image. The captured image is at 96x96 resolution, and the pre-loaded network is designed such that values >0.5 indicate a person is likely present.

## Adding your own model
It is very straightfoward to replace the pre-loaded model with other edge-impulse projects. Head over to your Edge Impulse project (created in one of the tutorials linked above), and go to Deployment. From here you can create the full library which contains the impulse and all external required libraries. Select Arduino library and click Build to create the library. Then download the .zip file, and place it in the `./lib/` directory of this repository.

Open the `platformio.ini` file in the root directory of this repository, and replace **line 16** to point to your newly downloaded .zip file library:
```
15 lib_deps = 
16 	./lib/edge-impulse-library.zip # change this line to the name of your edge-impulse library
```

Next, open `src/main.cpp` and on **line 2**, change the top level edge-impulse library header file to match the name of your Edge Impulse project:

```
2 #include <Person_Detection_Classification__inferencing.h>
```

If you aren't sure what the header name for your project would be, peek inside the .zip file library and copy the name of the single header file in the root directory.

## FAQ

### How can I build this with the Arduino IDE/CLI?
While not tested, this project should work with Arduino tools. All you should need to do is:
1. Add [ESP32 board support for Arduino](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/)
2. Copy the code from src/main.cpp into a new .ino sketch
3. Copy the ArduCAM library into your Arduino IDE's library folder (e.g `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`)
4. Add the exported Edge Impulse Arduino library via `Sketch->Include Library->Add .ZIP Library` from the IDE, or unzip it into the same library folder from step 3.

### My SPI or I2C interface is failing to initialize!
This is most likely from a faulty hardware connection, but could point to a malfunctioning ESP32 or Arducam board. To test for this, again triple check your hardware connections and note that depending on the specific flavor of ESP32 dev kit you are using, the pinout might be different from the example shown above. 

If the SPI interface is failing, try to connect the ESP32 MOSI and MISO pins to each other and verify that this 'loopback' correctly sends data back to the ESP32. Also check that the CS pin (pin 5 by default in this project) is toggling correctly and a clock output is present on the SCK pin.

If the I2C interface is failing, check the values returned by the I2C read. This tries to fetch the Arducam's VID and PID, and if they don't match the expected value you might be working with a different Arducam board other than the Mini 2MP Plus.

### The person detection model isn't performing well!
This is most likely due to the low resolution of the model input. The ArduCAM is taking 120x160 pixel photos, but only a center cropped 96x96 region is input into the neural network (as that was the resolution the model was trained on). This means you may need to stand further away from the camera for it to actually capture a full person in frame, and the low resolution may cause it to have trouble recognizing users in certain environments.

### Why does the firmware capture a JPEG from the ArduCAM, then convert to raw pixels?
The Arducam board can output raw pixel data, but it has some [known quirks](https://www.arducam.com/rgb565-format-issues/) that can make it challenging to accurately capture the raw pixels off of the camera directly. To work around this we use JPEG output which reliably encodes the color info, and then convert it to raw pixels using the excellent [JPEGDecoder](https://github.com/Bodmer/JPEGDecoder) library.
